# QC Live - Professional 24/7 Streaming Application

A powerful, self-hosted streaming application that enables 24/7 live streaming to YouTube, Twitch, and other RTMP platforms.

## Features

- 🎥 **24/7 Live Streaming** - Stream videos continuously with automatic looping
- 📺 **Multi-Platform Support** - Stream to YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, or any RTMP server
- 🎬 **Video Management** - Upload, organize, and manage your video library
- 📊 **Real-time Statistics** - Monitor stream health, bitrate, FPS, and quality
- 🔄 **Multiple Concurrent Streams** - Run multiple streams simultaneously
- 🎯 **Stream Quality Options** - Choose between 720p (2 Mbps) or 1080p (3.5 Mbps)
- 🛡️ **Secure Authentication** - Protected admin access
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Supabase channel connections

QC Live includes an optional Supabase-backed channel vault for YouTube Live, Twitch, Facebook Live, and any RTMP-compatible destination. The application authenticates the operator with its existing protected session, stores only an encrypted stream key in Supabase, and never returns the key to the browser. The migration is in `supabase/migrations/20260911235000_qc_live_channel_connections.sql`.

To enable it, apply that migration to your Supabase project and set `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and a strong `CHANNEL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` in the server environment. The configured project is in the `ap-northeast-1` region. The service-role key must remain server-side and must not be placed in any `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable.

The **Channels** page lets an operator save a destination, and the stream form can use a saved channel without exposing its secret. Provider OAuth is intentionally not faked: YouTube, Twitch, and Meta require separately registered client applications, redirect URLs, scopes, and platform review where applicable. Manual RTMP connections work immediately; OAuth adapters can be added once those provider credentials are supplied.
## System Requirements

- Node.js 18+ 
- FFmpeg (installed and accessible in PATH)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Sufficient bandwidth for streaming (3-5 Mbps upload per stream)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/qc-live.git
cd qc-live
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your settings:
- Generate a secure `SESSION_SECRET`
- Set your `ADMIN_USERNAME` 
- Generate password hash using bcrypt

### 4. Initialize Database
```bash
node scripts/setup-db.js
```

### 5. Start the Application

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: node:18-alpine
    container_name: qc-live
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
      - ./data:/app/data
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    command: >
      sh -c "
        apk add --no-cache ffmpeg python3 make g++ &&
        npm install &&
        npm rebuild sqlite3 &&
        npm run build &&
        npm start
      "
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Production Deployment

For true 24/7 operation, run the app and FFmpeg worker on a persistent Linux host or an always-on container service, with `restart: unless-stopped`, persistent `./data` and `./public/uploads` volumes, and enough outbound bandwidth for every destination. A 3.5 Mbps 1080p stream consumes approximately 3.5 Mbps per platform plus overhead; multiple platforms multiply both bandwidth and FFmpeg CPU usage. Add process supervision and monitoring before treating the service as production-grade.

### Using PM2

1. Install PM2 globally:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start with PM2:
```bash
pm2 start npm --name "qc-live" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Nginx Reverse Proxy

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Credentials** - Always update the default admin credentials
2. **Use HTTPS** - Deploy behind HTTPS in production
3. **Firewall Rules** - Only expose necessary ports
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies updated
5. **Backup** - Regular backup of database and uploaded videos

## Streaming Setup

### YouTube
1. Go to YouTube Studio → Go Live
2. Copy your Stream Key
3. Create a new stream in QC Live with YouTube platform
4. Paste your stream key

### Twitch
1. Go to Creator Dashboard → Settings → Stream
2. Copy your Primary Stream Key
3. Use Custom RTMP in QC Live
4. Enter: `rtmp://live.twitch.tv/live/YOUR_STREAM_KEY`

## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg Not Found
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
- Windows: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org)
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Mac: `brew install ffmpeg`

### Stream Stops Unexpectedly
- Check system resources (CPU, RAM)
- Verify network stability
- Review application logs
- Ensure video files are properly encoded

### Upload Issues
- Check file permissions on uploads directory
- Verify disk space availability
- Check maximum file size settings
